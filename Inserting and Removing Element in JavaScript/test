.outerHTML = This property reveals the element's entire HTML code, including its inner content and tag itself.

.tagName = This property identifies the element's HTML tag name (e.g., "div", "p").

.textContent = This property retrieves the combined text content, removing any HTML tags.

.hidden = This property determines if an element is hidden (returns true or false). Set .hidden = true to hide the element.

.hasAttribute("attribute_name") = This method checks if a specific attribute exists on an element (returns true or false).
