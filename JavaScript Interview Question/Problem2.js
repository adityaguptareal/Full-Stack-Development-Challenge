// The Double Trouble: You are tasked with writing a function that doubles each element in an array. However, there's a catch: if the array contains consecutive duplicate elements, only double one of them.

let arr=["a","b","c","d","e","f","f","e","g","h"]

function double_trouble(arr){
    for (const element of arr) {    
        if (element==element1) {
        let double=arr
        } else {
            double=arr.concat(arr)
            console.log(double);
        }    
    }
    
}





// function double_trouble(arr) {
    
// }
